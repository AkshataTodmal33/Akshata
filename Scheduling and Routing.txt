Scheduling and Routing:
- There is a schedule named cache hold present in the system. but it only loads new data at the start of the schedule.	

- When we schedule a dashboard, the server creates a cache in the RAM.
- As a prerequisite we need to check the whether, wherever the analysis file is there independent elements and database should have an access to schedule account system.
- Without scheduling account permission to that folder, the dashboard will get failed.
- If Dahboard is not cached, then user must have access to Exp file as well as dependent elements

Rule:
Analysis Rule: If u r using analysis tool, it has to be opened in particular web player
User rule: User rule means a user will be routed to a particular web player.
Group Rule: Group rule means a user in that group will be routed to a particular web player.

Resource Pool:
- U need resource pool to route the user to particular web player.
- Any webplayer can be part of 1 resource pool only.
- U need to choose the required resource pool according to requirements

Priority: Multiple caches and jobs are scheduled so priority is the order for the execution of these jobs 0-top,10-least
